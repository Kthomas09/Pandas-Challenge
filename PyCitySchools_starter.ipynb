    "When looking at the district data we can only see an overall view of how the school district performed over this academic year's testing cycle. It is reassuring that both the percentages of students passing math and reading are above 70% proficiency in those core testing area's. However, there is a cause of concern when looking at the students passing both subjects. This would make clear that there is a deficiency somewhere within the curriculum as testing data supports that there is a lower percentage of students able to become proficent in both reading and mathmatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we grouped the schools by type, it became abundently clear that the schools that were striving in their testing results were primarily charter schools. The lower performing schools were district supervised schools. Additionally, the spending per pupil had a slightly negitive correlation on testing scores. This is particularly alarming as spending per pupil does not increase the testing scores. This would lead tax payers to believe that their tax dollars are not increasing student achievement. School class sizes seems to have an impact on student testing performances, however, this is a bit misleading as many of the charter schools, which have a different set of critera and more freedom from district centalization tend to fall in the small school population bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an alarming trend is that across the board, is that Charter schools are seeing a higher achievement rate than that of centrally controlled district schools. There are a myrad of reasons as to why this may occur, and further analysis of the curriclum will need to be conducted to accurately dipict these deficiencies. However, the data does suggest that the centralization schools is not an effective method of maximizing student achievement. "
